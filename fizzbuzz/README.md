FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo
=============================

Developed using Python 3.6.

See the docstring in `fizzbuzz.py` for the problem description.

I chose to use Python because it has excellent developement velocity. It's particularly great for short scripts. As Python codebases get larger the nature of it as a dynamic interpreted language neccessitates careful testing during refactoring.

Execute `test.py` to run the tests
Execute `fizzbuzz.py` to run the main program
